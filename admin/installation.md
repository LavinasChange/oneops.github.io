OneOps is a complex application with many components and interactions as you can see in the
[key concepts documentation](./key-concepts.html). As a result installation is potentially a complicated
process.

The installation process can be performed by:

<ul>
<li><a href="../../developer/core-development/index.html">Building OneOps from source including creation of VM via Vagrant</a></li>
</ul>


From that initial install you can then to proceed to successfully operating
OneOps for your users including

- [Manage OneOps with OneOps](./operate/oneops-manages-oneops.html)
- [Upgrade OneOps](./operate/upgrading-one-ops.html)
- [Running OneOps in Production](./operate/running-oneops-in-production.html)

and others.
