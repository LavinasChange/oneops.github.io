# Compute Component

The _compute_ [component](./components.html) is of core importance and all platforms since it
represents the virtual machine and operating system on which the platform runs.

You can configure the compute component as part of your platform in design phase and specific to an environment in the
transition phase.

Once your assembly is deployed in an environment you can access the [computes in operation](../operation/compute.html).

## Configuration

Besides the global configuration available for any component such as _Name_ and _Description_, you can configure the
following attributes:

_Instance Size_: The instance size determines characteristics of the virtual machine created for operation in terms of
processing power, memory size, networking bandwidth and operating system. The size values use clothing sizing values
of from extra small to extra large and beyond - XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, 3XL, 4XL. Instance sizes optimized for compute
performance, network performance, storage and memory are available. The generic values are mapped to
[cloud](../account/clouds.html) specific sizes.

_Networking - PAT ports_: Configure the Port Address Translation PAT from internal ports (key) to external ports
(value). <br/>
_Networking - Require public IP_: Check if a public IP is required. Setting is used when the compute cloud service
public networking type is interface or floating.<br/>

The _Cloud Services_ configuration displays the services required by the component and provided by the cloud. Typically
_compute_ and _dns_ are required, while others such as _mirrors_ or _ntp_ are optional and can be enabled or disabled
as desired.

The _Compute Depends On_ and _Depend On Compute_ sections contain lists of related components.

The _attachements_ tab allows the configuration of [attachments](./attachments.html) associated to the compute.

The _monitors_ tab can be used to configure compute-related [monitors](../operation/monitors.html).


## Example Use Cases

### Update the Size or OS of a Compute

Changing a compute in design, like any other design change, requires you to:

- Save the change and commit the overall design.
- Pull the design to the environment.
- Deploy the environment.

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation fa-5x orange"></i> If you are changing a compute configuration like size or a related
setting all deployed instances [have to be flagged to be __replaced__](../operation/compute.html).

To roll out a change you need to either disable and re-enable the whole platform perform a rolling replacment.

A platform wide approach means that the application will be unavailable during the procedure.

1. Change the configuration of the compute in design.
2. Set the action to  _replace_ all the [computes in operation](../operation/compute.html).
3. Disable the entire platform.
4. Commit and deploy.
5. Enable the platform to commit and deploy.

Alternatively you can roll the change out via replacing computes:

1. Change the configuration of the compute in design.
2. Set the action to  _replace_ all the [computes in operation](../operation/compute.html).
3. Choose a step size of less than 100% for a rolling upgrade.
4. Pull the design changes to the environment.
5. Deploy to the environment.
