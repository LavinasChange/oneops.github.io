The _job_ [component](./components.html) is available in a number of platforms and can be used to execute specific
[cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) tasks on a regular schedule. Examples are _cassandra_, _es_ and many others.
Typically it is configured as an optional component and can simply be activated by adding it with the _+_ button in the
component list.

You can locate defined jobs with a [search](../general/search.html] using a _Class_ value of _manifest.Job_ for 
configured jobs in the design phase or _bom.Job_ for deployed jobs in the operation phase.
