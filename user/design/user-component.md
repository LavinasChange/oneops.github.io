# User Component

The _user_ [component](./components.html) controls operating system user accounts and their creation on the
[compute component](./compute-component.html) of the same platform and is typically an optional component. Adding a
user for example allows you to connect to the [compute in operation](../operation/compute.html) via ssh.
