## Phases Wizard

The phases wizard is displayed above the main content area and contains links to actions related to Account setup and
the  phases Design, Transition and Operate. The links are all context sensitive to the current organization and
assembly. The current phase is highlighted in green. It can be disabled with the close button on the right.

## Lists and Bulk Actions

Lists consist of a powerful header and the line items. The header on lists numerous features:

- _Sort_ button, optionally with selection of field to use for sorting
- Filter input with display of the number of records in the list
- Select all and unselect all boxes
- _New_ button to create new record
- _Action_ button

It items in the list itself display data and include a check box for bulk operation actions on the left and
item-specific action buttons on the right.

Bulk actions can be performed by checking one or multiple of the select check boxes on the left of the records and then
pressing the _Action_ button in the header and selecting the desired action in the drop down.

The available actions vary based on the records in the list and include actions such as save, edit, mark as favorite,
reboot and many others.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

OneOps supports a number of keyboard shortcuts that enable an advanced user to navigate to specific components and other
entities within the context of the current organization. These keyboard shortcuts trigger the appearance of an input
control in a pop up dialog. You can type multiple values to narrow down the returned data to the desired results. Up to
20 results are displayed. Clicking on a result allows the user to navigate to the entity.

`ALT-o`: navigate to a specific _organization_.<br/>
`ALT-d`: navigate to an entity in the _design_ phase.<br/>
`ALT-t`: navigate to an entity in the _transition_ phase.<br/>
`ALT-p`: navigate to an entity in the _operate_ phase.<br/>
`ALT-g`: _go_ to an entity, adding a stand-alone `d`, `t` or `o` character to the query narrows the results to the design,
transition or operation phases.<br/>

## Short URLs

OneOps supports some short URLs. A user can type these URLs faster and navigate to the entity with a known identifier.
