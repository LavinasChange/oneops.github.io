The _Manage Favorites_ link directs to a dedicated tab in the user profile. This view includes all favorites of the user
across all organizations in a list that includes a filter feature on the top of the list.

Entities can be marked as favorites with the bookmark icon to the right of the entity name in its main display

Or by selecting _Mark favourite_ from the more functions button on the right side of any entity in a list.
