Closing off our first year as open source project, we slowed down on the releases a bit for a code freeze towards
the end of year. The two October releases provided some rich enhancements and a stable base. With the year coming
to an end we are lined up well for a great release coming in January. Stay tuned for more on that right here on
the blog.
