The OneOps command line tool [Boo](https://github.com/oneops/boo/) is gaining a
lot of traction and usage. With that heavy usage come feature requests and bug
fixes. Thanks to the valiant efforts of our contributors and committers, we now
have a new release - __Boo 1.0.14__.

<!--more-->

Boo can be used to create new assemblies and environments in OneOps and get your
cloud application deployed. And all that with a yaml file and a command line
tool.

With the new release you are able to configure and create multiple environments.
This is an important aspect of OneOps where different environments can deployed
to mulitple clouds and be used for different usage patterns such as development,
testing and production.

We hope to find even more enthusiastic Boo users with the new release.

Enjoy,

_OneOps Team_
