The `tomcat` pack provides version 7 of the
[Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) web application server and is a very
popular pack for OneOps users running Java-powered web applications. With the
recent release we are bringing you an important update to the pack.

<!--more-->

First and foremose we are adding __support for version 8__. This means that
usage of Servlet Specification 3.1 and JSP Specification 2.3 is now possible in
your applications. Specifically Tomcat version 8.5.12 is now available. Please
see below for special consideration when upgrading.

We have also deprecated the `mirrors` attribute of the `tomcat` component. If
the attribute is empty we will now use the mirror service of the cloud.  All
users are encouraged to remove any mirrors they have defined and leave the cloud
administrators to take care of this detail for you. If defined the `tomcat`
component will continue to use that attribute for backwards compatibility.

The `build version` is deprecated in favor of one drop down for the complete
version as used by the the Tomcat project itself.  Deprecation notices are added
in the user interface as required for now and complete removal of the elements
will follow in a future release. Please ensure to move to a version that is not
deprecated.


## Upgrading to 8.5.12

If you are upgrading from 7.0.x to 8.5+, note that the pack contains a hardcoding
of the major version on the install directory and the name changes from
`tomcat7` to `tomcat8`. Make sure you review the `tomcat`, `artifact`, `daemon`
and other components as required, to ensure that any references to `tomcat7` are
updated to `tomcat8`. This hardcoded setup will be removed in the near future.
