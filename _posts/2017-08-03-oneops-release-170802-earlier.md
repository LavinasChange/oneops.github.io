Wow! What a whirlwind of changes to get it all together into one repository! If
you look at our [OneOps GitHub organization](https://github.com/oneops) you notice that the
number of repositories is greatly reduced now. The refactoring necessary to
get about a dozen repositories merged and the related changes to release
processes and more needed to be taken care of so our public releases dropped
a bit. We still did a bunch of them internally and released numerous changes to
our users.
