Some people can learn a lot from tinkering around with a tool. These users can
play with OneOps since [its all open source](http://github.com/oneops). Others
learn by reading documentation and we maintain our website for everyone with
lots of content and also include videos. Yet, there are many user, who learn
best when somebody shows them how things work and explains everything. If you
are one of these types of learners, we got something for you - OneOps Training.

We have started to created training material for OneOps and are now running
Walmart internal training classes for OneOps every week. To take that effort out
into our user community we are providing all the slides as open source project.

You can have a look at them and use them for your own OneOps training classes.
We are hosting them right here on the website so you can have a look yourself.

Beyond that we have recorded the whole class without any specific information
and making it all available on
[the OneOps video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjDnb0653uBDMBpTBoLVkVtGIDO-P8e3U):
