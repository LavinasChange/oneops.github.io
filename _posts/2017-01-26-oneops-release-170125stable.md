In addition to celebrating 
[one year OneOps as open source project](./2017-01-25-one-year-open-source.html)
we are giving you another release. This time we focused on polishing what we
delivered with the
[large release earlier this month](./2017-01-05-oneops-release-170105stable.html).
But, as usual, we also added a few new things.
