# OneOps Web Site

This is the source code of the OneOps website available at
[http://oneops.com](http://oneops.com).

Please feel free to make PRs to improve the site. Read our
[contribution](http://oneops.com/general/contribute.html) and
[documentation guidelines](http://oneops.com/general/doc-guideline.html) for
more information.


# Building

To view and edit the website you can use standard Jekyll

```
jekyll serve
```

This local build allows you to see the rendered site and access it at
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

# Blog posts

Blog posts are written in the `_drafts` folder and dated correctly for the
planned publishing date. Then when publishing should happen, the file is moved
to `_posts`.

During review and development of the blog post you have to start jekyll with
drafts and future enabled so you can see them as rendered.

```
jekyll serve --future --drafts
````

# Search

The search feature on the site uses the file
http://oneops.com/searchmap-es.json. It is generated from all content via some
Liquid code in the source searchmap-es.json. This file has no newline characters
in it to make it suitable for bullk-loading into Elasticsearch via the REST API
on the server.

Helper scripts used on the server can be found in the `scripts\elasticsearch`
directory. The `updateOneOpsIndex.sh` script is currently run manually whenever
desired. We might run it daily via CRON in the future. For server and access
detail, contact the contributor team.
