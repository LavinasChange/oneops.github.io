# Relations

The following model diagrams describe the relationships for Design, Transition, and Operations in the OneOps UI.
[Relationships](/developer/general/key-concepts.html) also have attributes, some of which are used to scale.

## Design

In the Design aspect, we model the base application:

* No environmental
* No operational components

## Transition

In the Transition aspect, we model two additional objects:

* **IaaS components:** Can be load balancers (`haproxy`) or DNS (`djbdns`). Can also use provider-based ones like `route-53`, `dyndns`, `elb`, etc.
* **Monitors:** Use to customize monitors for each environment

## Operations

In the Operations aspect, we create `bom` components for the manifest components with relation to the Binding (cloud provider).
