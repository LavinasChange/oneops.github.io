title: Getting Started with Core Development
---

__Core development__ is all about development on any component of the 
__OneOps application__ stack itself.

All source code for the various components is [available on GitHub]({{ site.github_url }}).

The OneOps build relies on Unix scripts and should work on OSX and Linux operating systems versions.

## Prerequisites

The following tools are required to build and run OneOps on a local developer machine.

Must have:

- [Java Development Kit 8 from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Apache Maven 3.5.0](http://maven.apache.org) (unless included Maven wrapper is used)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- [Gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
- [Packer](https://packer.io)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
- [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
- PostgreSQL 9.2 development file (libpg)
- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

Nice to have:

- Favorite IDE like EclipseIDE or STS
- Some Git UI
- And so on ...

## Building

Fork and clone the [oneops source repository](https://github.com/oneops/oneops)
and run a build with the Maven wrapper  in the created `oneops` directory:

```shell
cd oneops
./mvnw clean install
````

or directly with Maven, if you have it installed already.

```shell
cd oneops
mvn clean install
```

The build compiles, tests and builds all packages. 

If you want to run OneOps after a build, you can use the `vagrant` profile
during a build. It creates all necessary configuration for Vagrant to spin up
the newly built OneOps in a VirtualBox virtual machine.

```shell
mvn install -P vagrant
```

After a successful build with the profile you can find the necessary files for 
starting a VM with OneOps running in the `~/.oneops/vagrant` directory and start
the VM from there.

```shell
cd ~/.oneops/vagrant/
vagrant up
```

Once the VM is up and running, you can access the OneOps user interface at 
[http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

Subsequently you can `suspend` or `halt` the VM with vagrant or use the
VirtualBox user interface as desired. Refer to the Vagrant and VirtualBox
documentation for further information.

## Vagrant Setup

If you want to make this Oneops instance use the circuit code on your host 
machine then you need to create shared folders and setup inductor to use that 
circuit code. You also need to install the circuit to update the CMS database.
Below is a modified vagrant file to setup inductor to use our 
[circuit-oneops-1](https://github.com/oneops/circuit-oneops-1) code and to install 
the circuit. 

```
$script = <<SCRIPT
  echo "configuring inductor to use circuit-oneops-1"
  cd /opt/oneops/inductor

  echo "removing existing circuit-oneops-1 and shared symlinks"
  sudo unlink circuit-oneops-1
  sudo rm -Rf shared

  echo "creating symlinks to shared folders"
  sudo ln -s /Some/Path/On/Vagrant/circuit-oneops-1 circuit-oneops-1

  echo "circuit-oneops-1: circuit install"
  cd /opt/oneops/inductor/circuit-oneops-1
  circuit install

  echo "script completed successfully"
SCRIPT

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|

 config.vm.box = "oneops"

 # Use the vagrant-cachier plugin, if installed, to cache downloaded packages
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-cachier")
    config.cache.scope = :box
  end

  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3001, host: 3003
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3000, host: 9090
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 9091
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8161, host: 8166

 config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
   vb.gui = false
   vb.memory = 6144
   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuexecutioncap", "70"]
  end

  config.vm.synced_folder "/Some/Path/On/Host/circuit-oneops-1", "/Some/Path/On/Vagrant/circuit-oneops-1",owner: "root",group: "root"

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: $script
end
```

## Database Schema

OneOps uses a PostgreSQL database for model storage. Some information about the
model is available in the [relations documentation](./relations.html).

## Versioning And Releasing

The OneOps project uses a version scheme of yy.mm.dd-enumerator, e.g. 
17.08.02-01 and in development 17.08.02-01-SNAPSHOT.

The version can be manually updated to a new value such as 
`17.08.09-01-SNAPSHOT` with

```
mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion="17.08.09-01-SNAPSHOT"
```

Automated CI builds increase the enumerator and are used to create releases with
the Maven release plugin via

```
mvn release:prepare release:perform
```
## Common Issues and Tips

If you encounter problems installing postgresql on OSX you may need to use brew. 

```
brew update
brew install postgresql
gem install pg -v '0.17.0'
```

If the mvn commands above give you any trouble. Then make sure you are in the top 
level folder of the [oneops source repository](https://github.com/oneops/oneops) clone 
and run

```
./mvnw clean package -Pvagrant
```
