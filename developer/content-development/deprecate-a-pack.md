# How to Deprecate a Pack

There are two flags available that you use in `pack.rb` to deprecate a specific pack version:

{% highlight ruby %}
ignore true|false
enabled true|false
{% endhighlight %}

## `ignore`

The `ignore` flag is used before loading of the pack. If it is set to `true`, the pack will not be re-loaded and
therefore updated in OneOps. However a currently loaded pack will not be removed and therefore remain dormant in
place.

## `enabled`

The `enabled` flag defines the visibility of pack during the creation of a platform. If it is set to
`false`, the pack will not be visible to a user when creating a platform.

The pack can however still be used to create a platform with the API even when this flag is set to `false`.

*Note: If an existing environment uses a deprecated pack, it will not be affected and continue to function.*
