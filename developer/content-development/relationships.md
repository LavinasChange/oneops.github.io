# Relationships

Relationships have attributes like other objects modeled in OneOps. We are working on adding pages to visualize and explain all of them.

There are two primary relationships used in packs:

* `depends_on` Sets the order of deployment and dependency tree for escalation
* `managed_via` How to know where to connect for management. In most cases, this is a compute, but in some, it is a cluster or ring.

Relationships are modeled like [components](/developer/general/key-concepts.html#component), with the same directory structure. Relationships also have attributes.

For more detail regarding relations for Design, Transition and Operations, see
[Relations](/developer/core-development/relations.html).
